# wisc_mac_SPPARKS

This is the updated version of lattice Kinetic Monte Carlo framework.
The original framework: https://github.com/spparks/spparks

---------------------------------------------------------------------
This updated version is designed for corrosion kinetics study.
The developer: Lin-Chieh Yu, Yongfeng Zhang from University of Wisconsin - Madison

# Introduction
  Corrosion kinetics:
  The corrosion can be separated into 5 kinetics processes. The processes are simplified with certain assumption.
  More kinetics processes may be included in the future
  1. Mass transport in liquid
  2. Chemical reaction (corrosion)
  3. Diffusion, including surface diffusion and lattice diffusion


  Other kinetics is included for special purpose:
  1. Sink generation or absorption
  2. 


# Install: To be continue!
Prerequisites:
  C++
  Cmake
  Git
  OpenMP
  Python (optional)

OS:
  This executable code can be worked in MacOS and Linux system.
  This code is tested and running on personal Mac desktop and high performance cluster on UW-Madison CHTC or national Lab.
  Some compilation error may come out and needs to modify if needed.

# Analysis: To be continue!
In the analysis section, I made two differenet kinds of analysis tools, which can verify the code itself or process the data during the KMC running.
Those tools are helpful and can be used to understand how the code running or bug generating on-time.
Special feature: special flag
  corrosion stop flag
  

Code analysis:
  All event infomation print:
  Evaporation event print:
  non-positive barrier event print:
  Large propensity event print:
  Dump all events:
  dump event per diag time:
  time check
  
Data analysis:
  MSD calculation
  site concentration (occupancy)
  vacancy concentration in lattice

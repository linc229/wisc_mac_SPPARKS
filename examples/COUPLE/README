This directory has examples of how to use SPPARKS as a library, either
by itself or in tandem with another code or library.

These examples is meant to illustrate what is possible when coupling
codes or calling SPPARKS as a library.  The examples are provided for
demonstration purposes.  The physics they calculate is too simple to
model a realistic problem.

See these sections of the SPPARKS manaul for details:

2.5 Building SPPARKS as a library (doc/Section_start.html#start_5)
6.2 Coupling SPPARKS to other codes (doc/Section_howto.html#howto_2)

In all of the examples included here, SPPARKS must first be built as a
library.  Basically, you type something like

make makelib
make -f Makefile.lib g++

in the SPPARKS src directory to create liblammps_g++.a

The library interface to SPPARKS is in src/library.cpp.  Routines can
be easily added to this file so an external program can perform the
SPPARKS tasks desired.

<UL><LI>dump-ID = user-assigned name for the dump 

<LI>style = <I>text</I> or <I>image</I> 

<LI>delta = time increment between dumps (seconds) 

<LI>filename = name of file to dump snapshots to 

<LI>fields = list of arguments for a particular style

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>text</I> style dumps a snapshot of site values to one or more files
at time intervals of <I>delta</I> during a simulation.  The <I>image</I> style
creates a JPG or PPM image file of the site configuration every at
time intervals of <I>delta</I>, as discussed on the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> doc page.  The remainder of this page
refers to the <I>text</I> style.
</P>
<P>As described below, the filename determines the kind of output (text
or binary or gzipped, one big file or one per timestep, one big file
or one per processor).  The quantities printed are obtained from the
application.  Only <A HREF = "app_style.html">on-lattice and off-lattice
applications</A> support dumps since they are spatial in
nature.  More that one dump command and file can be used during a
simulation by giving each a unique dump-ID.  Note that if written in
appropriate format, a snapshot from a dump file can easily be
converted into a data file suitable for input via the
<A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> command to restart a simulation.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: When running in parallel, the order of sites as
printed to the dump file will be in chunks by processor, not ordered
by ID.  The order will be the same in every snapshot.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "dump_modify">dump_modify</A> command can be used to alter the times
at which snapshots are written out as well as defined a subset of
sites to write out.
</P>
<P>The text-based dump file is in the format of a <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS dump
file</A> which can thus be read-in by the <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py
toolkit</A>, converted to other formats, or used for visualization.
An important modification to the LAMMPS-style header for each snapshot
is the addition of real time to the line containing the snapshot
number, i.e.
</P>
<PRE>ITEM: TIMESTEP TIME
100   3.23945 
</PRE>
<P>The entry for "NUMBER OF ATOMS" is really number of sites, and will
reflect any reduction in site count due to the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command, i.e.
</P>
<PRE>ITEM: NUMBER OF ATOMS
314159 
</PRE>
<P>If fields are listed, then only those quantities will be printed for
each site.  If no fields are listed, then a default set of fields are
output, namely "id site x y z".  These are the possible field values
which may be specified.
</P>
<P>The <I>id</I> is a unique integer ID for each site.
</P>
<P>The <I>site</I>, <I>iN</I>, and <I>dN</I> fields specify a per-site value.  <I>Site</I> is
the same as <I>i1</I>.  <I>iN</I> fields are integer values; <I>dN</I> fields are
floating-point value. The application defines how many integer and
floating=point values are stored for each site.
</P>
<P>The <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I> values are the coordinates of the site.
</P>
<P>The <I>energy</I> value is what is computed by the energy() function in the
application.  Likewise for the <I>propensity</I> value which can be thought
of as the relative probablity for that site to perform a KMC event.
Note that if the application only performs rejection KMC or Metropolis
MC, then no propensity is defined.
</P>




<HR>

<P>The specified filename determines how the dump file(s) is written.
The default is to write one large text file, which is opened when the
dump command is invoked and closed when an <A HREF = "undump.html">undump</A>
command is used or when SPPARKS exits.
</P>
<P>Dump filenames can contain two wild-card characters.  If a "*"
character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is
written and the "*" character is replaced with the timestep value.
For example, tmp.dump.* becomes tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.10000,
tmp.dump.20000, etc.
</P>
<P>If a "%" character appears in the filename, then one file is written
for each processor and the "%" character is replaced with the
processor ID from 0 to P-1.  For example, tmp.dump.% becomes
tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.1, ... tmp.dump.P-1, etc.  This creates smaller
files and can be a fast mode of output on parallel machines that
support parallel I/O for output.
</P>
<P>Note that the "*" and "%" characters can be used together to produce a
large number of small dump files!
</P>
<P>If the filename ends with ".bin", the dump file (or files, if "*" or
"%" is also used) is written in binary format.  A binary dump file
will be about the same size as a text version, but will typically
write out much faster.  Of course, when post-processing, you will need
to convert it back to text format, using your own code to read the
binary file.  The format of the binary file can be understood by
looking at the src/dump.cpp file.
</P>
<P>If the filename ends with ".gz", the dump file (or files, if "*" or
"%" is also used) is written in gzipped format.  A gzipped dump file
will be about 3x smaller than the text version, but will also take
longer to write.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used as part of on-lattice or off-lattice
applications.  See the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command for further
details.
</P>
<P>To write gzipped dump files, you must compile SPPARKS with the
-DSPPARKS_GZIP option - see the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_2">Making
SPPARKS</A> section of the documentation.
